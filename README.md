# Data Analysis Projects
This repository contains a collection of projects I worked on while enrolled at Western Governor's University (WGU). I graduated with a Master's of Science in Data Analytics from in 2022, and these were completed between May 2021 and May 2022.

All projects were used Python programming language in a Jupyter notebook. Write-ups outline the assignments and discuss their goals, parameters, limitations, conclusions, and limitations.
