# Data Analysis Projects
A collection of projects I completed while enrolled at Western Governor's University (WGU). I graduated with a Master's of Science in Data Analytics from in 2022.
All projects were used Python programming language in a Jupyter notebook. Write-ups outline the assignments, along with their goals, parameters, and limitations.
